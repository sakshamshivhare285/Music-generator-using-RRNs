# Music-generator-using-RRNs
This project implements a music generation system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs are a powerful type of neural network that excel at handling sequential data, making them ideal for tasks like music generation.

This system is designed to:

Learn from a dataset of musical pieces.
Identify patterns and relationships within the music.
Generate new musical sequences that resemble the training data.
The generated music can be used for various purposes, such as:

Composing original music pieces.
Creating backing tracks for other musicians.
Experimenting with different musical styles.
Features:
RNN Architecture: The system utilizes an RNN architecture, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture long-term dependencies in music data.
Music Representation: Music is represented using a suitable format, such as MIDI or mel-spectrogram, for efficient processing by the RNN.
Training on Dataset: The system is trained on a dataset of musical pieces to learn the underlying musical patterns.
Music Generation: After training, the system can generate new musical sequences that reflect the styles and patterns present in the training data.
Dependencies:
This project requires several external libraries, including:

TensorFlow or PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)
NumPy (Numerical Computing)
(Optional) Music libraries like MIDIutil or librosa for music processing
Note: Specific library versions may be required for compatibility.
